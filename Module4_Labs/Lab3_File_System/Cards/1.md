We will be representing a simple file structure with a directed graph. You will receive a text file on which to base it off of. The file will contain a bunch of file and folder names written in the format: `###. some words`

- the numbers representing the "level" of the folder/file. `0` being the root folder and `01` being a subfolder of `0`, so on and so forth
  - you can assume that the level or the number of folders/files per level will never surpass `9`
  - you can assume that the root will always be `0`
- `some words` represents the "name" of the folder/file, similar to how you would name your folders

In the first part of the program, you will have to parse through the file to get both the structural numbers, and the names of the folders/files to represent them in a directed graph. In this lab, you will make the graph yourself, display the graph using `networkx`, and write the contents of the graph to a file.
