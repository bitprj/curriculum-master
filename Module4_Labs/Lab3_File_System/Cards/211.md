To add edges to a graph, we first have to initialize a graph. This is done through writing:

```python
G2 = Graph()
```

To be able to create a new Grpah object, we have to have a Graph **constructor**, in which we have to initialize any **attributes** it may have. In out case, the edges and the values of the nodes are the most important, so we are going to store them as attributes:

```python
def __init__(self):
	self.edges = defaultdict(list)
	self.val_map = {}
```

To add elements into the edges attribute, we should write a method which adds the edges on by one. Since it is a directed graph, we should accept a `from_node` and a `to_node`:

```python
def add_edge(self, from_node, to_node):
	self.edges[from_node].append(to_node)
```

From the previous part, we should have constructed a list of edges from the file as we were reading it in, storing the parent as the tuple's first element, and it's child as it's second element. But since our function only adds one edge at a time, we have to add the edge as we iterate through the graph:

```python
for edge in edges:
  G2.add_edge(*edge)
```
