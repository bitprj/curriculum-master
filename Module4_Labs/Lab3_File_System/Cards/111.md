First, we have to open and read the file line by line in order to read every folder and its associated number:

```python
readFile = open("textOutline.txt", "r")
for line in readFile:
```

To separate the names from the numbers, we would have to split the line between the number and the words. In order to do that, we can use the built-in `split()` function. However that still leaves extra space before the name, so we will use the `strip()` function. Store these two parts in a list, named `dirAndVal` here:

```python
dirAndVal = line.split(". ")
dirAndVal[1] = dirAndVal[1].strip()
```

To find and store the edges for later use, we can slice the structural string to everything but the last character. Notice how this new sliced string is the structural character of the parent of the current one. We are going to represent each individual edge as a tuple, and all the edges as a list. Here we make one edge, store it as a tuple, and add it to the list:

```python
aTuple = (dirAndVal[0][:-1], dirAndVal[0])
edges.append(aTuple)
```

Remember to check to check your **edge cases**!

```python
if(dirAndVal[0] != "0"):
```
