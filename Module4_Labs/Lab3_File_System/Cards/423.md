We want to finally call `print_ordered_file_structure()` in `main()` in order to write our output to the output file. 

We call it on our `G2` since that is the graph we constructed manually, and we provide the argument `"0"`, since that will signify our *root* of the graph.

```python
    G2.print_ordered_file_structure("0")
```
