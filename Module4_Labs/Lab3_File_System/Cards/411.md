You need to create a `visited`  `defaultdict(bool)`. We have to use a `defaultdict` because we need to index our `visited` by the string that identifies a given node, i.e `"011"`. 

```python
        visited = defaultdict(bool)
```

A `stack` must be created since it will hold which nodes we need to visit next, unlike a `queue` here it will enable us to print out our "folders" in the correct relative order:

```python
		stack = []
```

Since we want to start with `start`, we need to push it onto our stack

```pyt
		stack.append(start)
```

And since we are pushing `start` onto our stack that means we will have already visited it, so we need to mark it as such:

```python
		visited[start] = True
```
