For this card, we strongly recommend you to grab a piece of paper and a pencil with you to draw the reversing process. It would make things more clear to you as you follow and draw the list for every change.

In the **reverse()**, you should first check whether your doubly linked list is empty by checking if the the head node has a `None` value. 

Otherwise, the list is not empty and is safe to reverse. Make a variable **curr** that is a copy to the head node, and make another variable **temp** with a value `None`. Make the tail node a copy of the **curr**.

Now, think about the hint below and draw out the graph as you reverse the list manually.

If you current node is **curr**, the previous node of **curr** becomes the next node of **curr**, and vice versa. You need a medium to store the temporaray and complete this process. After that, your **curr** should move to the previous node. Repeat this process until your the value of **curr** become `None`.

The instruction above might be confusing, but just draw the graph by yourself and think about it carefully.
