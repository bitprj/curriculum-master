  Similar to insertion, there are also multiple ways to delete elements from a doubly linked list, and they are the same as introduced in the previous card. Check out the description and implement these function in your doubly linked list class.

  **Deleting Elements From the Start**

  - Define a function called **popFront()** which does not take in any parameter.
  - If the list is empty, return
  - Otherwise, delete the head node.

  **Deleting Elements From the End**

  - Define a function called **popBack()** which also take in no parameter.
  - If the list is empty, return
  - Otherwise, delete the tail node.

  **Deleting Elements by Value**

  Write a function called **pop()**. In this method, you need to think carefully since several cases have to be handled in order to remove an element by value.

  - This function takes in a value as the parameter.
  - If the list is empty, return
  - If the node (contianing the value) to be inserted is not in the list, print the message: "Target not found"."
  - Otherwise, remove the node that contains the element in the list.
