The first function that will be made for this class is `push(newData)` which adds a new node to the **head** of the list.

We are going to create a new node with any `data`  that we want and insert it at the `head` of the list.

```python
def push(self, newData):
  	newNode = Node(newData)
    
    # newNode -> self.head
  	newNode.next = self.head

    # If the list is not empty
  	if self.head != None:
    		self.head.prev = newNode
    
    # If the list is empty
    else:
        self.head = newNode
        self.tail = newNode
		
    # The head is now the new node
    self.head = newNode
    self.size += 1
```

The function `push` relies on `self.head` to keep track of the first node. You can think of this process as cutting to the front of the line. You are the `newNode` and you insert yourself infront of the <u>first</u> person in line. You are now at the **front** of the line, with the `head` pointing at you and the person behind you being `next`. In the case of pushing to an empty list, you can just make the head and the tail the new node.
