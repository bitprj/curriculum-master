The **insertAfter()** takes in two parameters: the value; the node to be inserted after. We can not insert a node after another node if the list contains no nodes, and this is again the empty list check!

If the list is empty, you can return.

Otherwise, you will do something similar to **pushback()** where you traverse the list until you find the node to be inserted after. If you don't find the node after the tail node, you should insert the new node into the tail node.

Else if the node exist in the list, insert the new node after the selected node. By doing this, you need to adjust the next and previous pointers to the new node, the node (A) to be inserted after, and the node after the node A.

Make sure your pointers are set up properly because this is the key to this function.
