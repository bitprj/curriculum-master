The function **popFront()** has no parameter. In order to properly pop the head node of a list, you need to check the following conditions:

If a list is empty, its head node should have a `None` value, then you can return.

If the list only contains one node, your list will have no elements after this opertion. Then, what should your head node status be?

If the list contains more than one node, change your head node and the previous pointer of the original head node.
