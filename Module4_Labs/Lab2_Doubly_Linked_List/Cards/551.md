In the case of wanted to insert before the head, 

The function `insertBefore(target, newData)` is very similar to the previous function we did. If we wanted to insert a new node between the 2nd and 3rd node, we would call `insertBefore(3rd node, newData)`.

```python
def insertBefore(self, target, newData):

		# If the list is empty
  	if self.head == None:
    		return

  	else:
    		curr = self.head
        
    		# 2. Search for target node
    		while curr.data != target:
      			curr = curr.next
      			if curr == None:
        				print("Target not found.")
        				return
              
				# 3. If target was found, curr != None
      	newNode = Node(newData)
      	newNode.prev = curr.prev
      	newNode.next = curr

      	# 4. If curr is not the first node
      	if curr.prev != None:
        		curr.prev.next = newNode

        else:
          	self.head = newNode
				
        # 5. Connect the current node with the new node
     		curr.prev = newNode

   # Increment size
   self.size += 1
```

For `insertBefore(target, newData)`, we will (1) check if the list is empty, (2) then search for the `target` node and have a pointer to it named `curr` for current node. If `curr` is equal to `None`,  that means we were not able to find the target in the list. If `target` was found, (3) initialize a `newNode` with the `newData` and establish connections for `next` and `prev`. (4) Now check if it's not the first node in the list. We do this because if we are at first node in the list, `newNode.prev` will already point to `None`. If we are at the first node, we will also set the new node as `self.head`. Finally, we (5) make the current node's `prev` point to the new node.
