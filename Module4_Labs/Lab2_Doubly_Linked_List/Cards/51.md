Define a function called **push()**, this function will take a value as the parameter. Inside this function, you need to check whether the list is empty (hint: check the status of the head node).

If this is an empty list, then make a new node with the given element, and insert that new node into your list (hint: if you insert a new node into an empty list, what should the head node be?).
