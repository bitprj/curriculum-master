Before writing the file to array. Open `fileName`, and read in the data. Hint: Use ` readlines()`.

![Reading](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F794015686%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale)

Then, iterate through all the lines in the data and all the words in the line. 

Decipher what each number represent and store them correspondingly to our matrix, representing the map/grid. 

>0 means blank
>
>1 means wall
>
>3 means exit!

Recall that we should store the Unicode of the blank, walls, and exit.  Store blank as 32, wall as 9608, and 9618 as exit, if you want to follow the sample program. But feel free to customize your graphic by your choice of unicode.

At last, close the file and return the grid.
