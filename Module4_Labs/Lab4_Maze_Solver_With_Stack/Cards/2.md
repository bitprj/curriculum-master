Now, let's load files, and convert them to a maze map!

![maze file](https://projectbit.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/darlene/cards/maze_file.png)

Notice how in `maze.txt` all the 1s are walls and 0s are paths, and the exit is 3. 

In this step, write a `loadFile(fileName)`function that loads the file and stores all the variables accordingly into a 2D array that is 30 by 100. 

Hint: Instead of storing 0, 1, and 3s directly, store the Unicode of the blanks, walls, and exits in the array.  We want to store Unicode So we can print graphic using `chr()` later. So in this case, we would store blanks as 32, walls as 9608, and the exit as 9618.

And later, they will result like this :
