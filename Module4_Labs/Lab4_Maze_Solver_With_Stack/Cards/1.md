In this lab, we will be writing a Maze Solver using Stack as our data structure.

In this Maze Solver, our cursor is represented as X, and it will visit all the branches until it finally finds exit!

When an exit is found, the program will print Done! :)

Our first task is to write a class `Stack`. 

We will have the following methods in our class:

> `__init__` : initialize two class variables, index and arr. `index` keeps track of the location of the top of the stack, and `arr` is the stack.
>
> `push`: takes in parameter `a` and put it on the top of the stack.
>
> `pop`:  delete the item on top of the stack and return its value.
>
> `top`: return value at the top of stack
>
> `isFull`: check if stack is full
>
> `isEmpty`: check if stack empty

Note: Refrain from using python's `append` and `pop` functions to implement `Stack`.
