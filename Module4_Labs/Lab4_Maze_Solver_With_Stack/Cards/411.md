Declare `r` and `c` to keep track of your current location in the maze.

```python
r = 1
c = 0 
```

Recall that the starting location of the maze is (1,0). So our initialization should reflect that.

Recall that maze array contains the Unicode of our maze, therefore, our while loop should look like: 

```python
while maze[r][c] != # your unicode for exit
```

My Unicode for exit is 9618 but feel free to customize.
