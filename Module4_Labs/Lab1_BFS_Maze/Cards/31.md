In order to return a list of non-visited neighbors, we first need to generate all neighbors. Each space will only have four neighbors in the north, south, west and east directions. Keep track of a list of coordinates that are their neighbors in a list. 

**hint:** think of how we can find the index of neighbors in relation to the index of the space.
