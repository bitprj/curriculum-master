Spaces are given as a tuple in the form (row, col).

Therefore given a space `space`, we can find the row of the `space` with `space[0]` and column of the `space` with `space[1]`. 

* The space to the north would be represented as  `(space[0] - 1, space[1])`. 
* The space to the south would be represented as  `(space[0] + 1, space[1])`. 
* The space to the west would be represented as  `(space[0], space[1] - 1)`. 
* The space to the east would be represented as  `(space[0], space[1] + 1)`. 

### Code in Python

We have to create our list of spaces:

```python
spaces = list()
```

Then we have to append spaces for each cardinal direction. Using the space to the north, we can append the space to the north like so:

```python
spaces.append((space[0]-1, space[1]))  # Up
```

In a similar manner we can append the space to the south:

```python
spaces.append((space[0]+1, space[1]))  # Down
```

And to the left:

```python
spaces.append((space[0], space[1]-1))  # Left
```

And to the right:

```python
spaces.append((space[0], space[1]+1))  # Right
```
