Now that we have a list of neighboring spaces, we have to check if each neighboring space has been visited or not. Initialize another list to be the **non-visited** neighbors. For each neighboring space, if the neighboring space is <u>not a wall and has not been visited yet</u> then add this neighbor to the list of non-visited neighbors. 

Then return this list.
