Please reference the starter code for details on `BFS()`, as well as how it is used in `main()`. 

For the final part of our code, implement a BFS search algorithm for this problem that looks at all the paths until the shortest path is found.

- Bear in mind that you will have to do some code maneuvering in the very first iteration of your while loop due to a technicality with tuples in Python.
