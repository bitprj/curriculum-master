# printGrid()

Now remember that our grid is a 2-D list formatted as a 9x9 which means that we have a list containing 9 lists that each have 9 numbers. Thus, we will need a **nested for-loop** which consists of two **for-loops** and two variables for **indexing**: one variable to iterate through the lists in `grid`, and another variable to iterate through the elements in the each list within  `grid`.  

```python
def printGrid(grid):
  for row_index,row in enumerate(grid):
    rowString = ""
    # do formatting here
    for index,element in enumerate(row):
      # do formatting here
    print(rowString)
```

> Note: we use `enumerate()` instead of `range()` because it allows us to iterate through our grid using a **tuple**, where one variable represents the index and another variable represents the value at that index.

In the first for-loop,`row_index` will be used to iterate through the rows (`row`) in our `grid`. In the second for-loop, `index` will be used to iterate through each `row` and `element` corresponds to the value at `index`.

Within each for-loop, all that's left is a series of if/if-else statements with logic that will be used to format the Sudoku board to be printed. At the end of each `row` we generate, we then print `rowString` to progressively print out our board row by row.
