# Working Within a Box

We will initialize a list called `elems` which will be a list that contains the elements 1-9 such that `elems = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. We will do so by defining `elems` as seen below:

```python
def box(grid,r_i,c_i):
	elems = list(range(1,10))
```

The reason being that we have this list `elems` which contains the numbers 1-9, is because since each box in a Sudoku board can only contain numbers from 1-9 without repeats, we will remove the values in `elems` that exist in the specified box. Thus, returning  `elems` will provide a list of numbers that are still needed within the box to fill in for the empty elements.

Now remember, since a box consists of 3 rows and 3 columns comprising 9 values, we will need a nested for-loop. So now you must be wondering- what is the range for iterating through our for-loops? The possible values passed in for `r_i` and `c_i` are in `range(0,3)` which implies that it can be any number from 0, 1, or 2. This is the case because the box is a 3x3 segment in our 9x9 Sudoku board. There are a total of 9 boxes within the Sudoku board. Thus, the range for our for-loops we be defined as such:

```python
	for r in range(r_i*3,r_i*3+3):
		for c in range(c_i*3,c_i*3+3):
```



Now consider we want to check the first box (the top left box in a Sudoku board). The values of `r_i` and `c_i` passed into the function would be 0 and 0. If we plug that into our for-loops we would look like this:

````python
	for r in range(0*3,0*3+3):
		for c in range(0*3,0*3+3):
````

We could see that for `r` and `c` we would loop from 0 to 2 which would cover all the elements within the first box: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2). Remember that `range(0,3)` means we iterate from 0 to 2, not 0 to 3.



Our function will now look like this thus far:

```python
# This returns all elements in a given box
def box(grid,r_i,c_i):
	elems = list(range(1,10))
	for r in range(r_i*3,r_i*3+3):
		for c in range(c_i*3,c_i*3+3):
			# implement logic in here
```

All we need to do left is to implement the logic inside our nested for-loop to remove the elements in our `elems` list that exist in the box.
