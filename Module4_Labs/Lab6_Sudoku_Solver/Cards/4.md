# findPossible() Function

In Sudoku, we are able to replace an empty square if we have eliminated all other possible values that cannot be a repeat. We can find the possible values for an empty square by checking all the numbers that exist within the same box of the square, within the same row of the square, and within the same column of the square.

Given that we are on a square (1 out of 81) in our Sudoku board, we will write the function `findPossible()` which finds all possible values for a square by eliminating numbers already in the box that it's in, the row it's in, and the column it's in. 

The function will take in the same three arguments as previously implemented in `box()`: the grid (`grid`), a row index (`r_i`) and a column index (`c_i`). The function header will then be defined as such:

```python
def findPossible(r_i, c_i, grid):
```
