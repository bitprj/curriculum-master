# isValid() Function

Starting off with the function definition accepting the `grid` as an argument, we will have:

```python
def isValid(grid)
```

Now since we know that we need to check if there are no repeats in any rows or columns within `grid`, we will need two nested for-loops: one to check that all rows contain no repeats and another to check that all columns contain no repeats. If both nested for-loops iterate through the grid successfully, then the grid is deemed valid so return True.

```python
def isValid(grid)
  for row in grid:
    for i in row:
      # implement logic here to check for repeats in all rows
      
  for c in range(0,9):
    for r in range (0,9):
      # implement logic here to check for repeats in all columns
      
  return True
```



For the first nested for-loop, the outer-loop iterates through each `row` in `grid` :

```python
for row in grid:
```

and then the inner-loop iterates through each element `i`  in  `row`:

```python
for i in row:
```

This is because each of the 9 lists inside of `grid` represents each `row`, and thus you can simply iterate through the elements in a `row` to make comparisons for checking repeated values.



Now notice that for the second nested for-loop, we are iterating through  `range(0,9)`, which is looping from 0 to 9, in both inner and outer loops. This is because we must iterate through each `row` at the same index in order to compare the elements within the same column since our `grid` is a list of rows.

```python
for c in range(0,9):
   for r in range (0,9):
```

For example, if we check all the values for the first column (`c == 0`), we will iterate through the rows (`r`) from `0-9`.



Here's a sample representation of how the rows and columns are within a 3x3 2-D list similar to `grid`:
