# testPossible()

As stated previously we first need to duplicate our `grid` to preserve the original `grid` since we are modifying the duplicate by storing the value `n` at the square (`r`,`c`):

```python
def testPossible(grid,r,c,n,depth,finish):
	dup = copy.deepcopy(grid)
	dup[r][c] = n
```

Then we need to check if `dup` will succeed through our function `complete()`, so we will do this in an if-statement as seen below:

```python
	if complete(dup,depth):
```

As of now, our function will look like this altogether:

```python
def testPossible(grid,r,c,n,depth,finish):
	dup = copy.deepcopy(grid)
	dup[r][c] = n
	if complete(dup,depth):
```



If the condition above succeeds, then all we need to do left is check if `finish` is true. If so, then we will copy `dup` back to grid since we now have a solution!
