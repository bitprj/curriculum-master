# main() Part 1

At last, we finally have all of the functioning pieces necessary to solve any Sudoku puzzle! However, we still need to be able to take the input from the user so we know what puzzle they want to solve and what actions they want to take. 

We will first start off by implementing the portion in which we will ask the user what Sudoku puzzle they want to complete. They will be asked to enter in a total of 81 characters, numbers ONLY, for their initial Sudoku board (`grid`). There are two error cases that we need to handle for the Sudoku board that the user specifies:

- If there was not a total of 81 characters, the user will be prompted: 
  - `"Not 81 characters."`
- If the Sudoku board is invalid (repeated values in same row, column or box), the user will be prompted:
  - `"Invalid grid."`

To provide directions to the user when we are awaiting their input for 81 characters, the prompt will address them to:

- `"Type in the grid, going left to right row by row, 0 = empty: "`



Just for an example of a valid user input for a `grid`, this is what it would appear as:

`940020700001004009006000120000003010100000008070500000087000200600900300009080057`

The input above would correspond to a `grid` that looks like this when printed:

```python
                                  9 4 _ | _ 2 _ | 7 _ _ 
                                  _ _ 1 | _ _ 4 | _ _ 9 
                                  _ _ 6 | _ _ _ | 1 2 _ 
                                  ------|-------|-------
                                  _ _ _ | _ _ 3 | _ 1 _ 
                                  1 _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ 8 
                                  _ 7 _ | 5 _ _ | _ _ _ 
                                  ------|-------|-------
                                  _ 8 7 | _ _ _ | 2 _ _ 
                                  6 _ _ | 9 _ _ | 3 _ _ 
                                  _ _ 9 | _ 8 _ | _ 5 7 
```
