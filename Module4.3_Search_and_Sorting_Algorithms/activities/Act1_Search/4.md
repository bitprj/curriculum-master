This code is the code we use to test our BFS algorithm.  We initialize this graph with by writing :

```python
g = Graph() 
```

Furthermore, we add edges between nodes by the addEdge() function. The first argument is the node that we start the edge from and the second parameter is the node where we end the edge connection.

```python
g.addEdge(0, 1) 
g.addEdge(0, 2) 
g.addEdge(1, 2) 
g.addEdge(2, 0) 
g.addEdge(2, 3) 
g.addEdge(3, 3) 
```

Finally, we initialize the BFS algorithm by specifying which node we start the algorithm from.

```python
print ("Following is Breadth First Traversal"
				" (starting from vertex 2)") 
g.BFS(2) 
```



Here is graphical representation of what the above graph looks like in "theory":

Here is a BFS algorithm in Python:

The first line here gets something called a "defaultdict" from the collections library. A "defaultdict" is basically a dictionary data structure but instead of giving you an error when you try to access a key that doesn't exist: its makes it for you with a default value you pass in. <sup>Â **1**</sup>

```python
from collections import defaultdict
```

Here we initialize the graph class. What you need to know is simple: the __init__ function is called when a new graph object is made. When it is called, it just attaches defaultdict to the object. 

```python
class Graph: 

	def __init__(self): 		
		self.graph = defaultdict(list)
```

What the next piece of code basically means is: we create a function addEdge that takes the starting node(u) and final node(v) and connects them via an edge. In terms of code, we store the u as the key in the graph's defaultdict and store all its connecting nodes in a list we can access through said key.

```python
	def addEdge(self,u,v): 
		self.graph[u].append(v)         
```

So, if I wanted to create a graph with 3 nodes(node 1,2,3) which are connected by one edge from 1 to 2 and 1 to 3, it would look like this:

Now let's get in to the real meat of this code: function BFS.  "s" in the function parameters is the node we decided to start our BFS algorithm on. 

```python
	def BFS(self, s):       
```

On to the next line! All this lines does is set all of our nodes to "not visited" [`visited` keeps track of the vertices that have been visited. ]. It just does it in fancy way. For example, [False,False,False] is equivalent to [False] * 3 ==> where 3 is the number of edges in the graph.

```python
visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
```

Your doing great, let's move ahead! Now here we initialize the queue and add our starting node into it(which is s). Finally we set our node "s" to visited!

```python
		queue = [] 
		queue.append(s) 
		visited[s] = True
```

We are almost done! This function(BFS) prints out the nodes we visit by using the BFS algorithm.  

Next. we look through our queue and pop out the oldest node we added to it.  We stop looking when our queue runs out of nodes!

```python
		while queue:  
			s = queue.pop(0) 
			print (s, end = " ") 
			
```

The final stretch, I know you can do this! Here we loop though all the adjacent nodes(relative to s) and add them to the queue if we haven't visited them. During our tree traversal we find we have no more adjacent nodes(relative to the node we are currently on), we just go back to the oldest node that takes us to an unvisited node. 

```python
			for i in self.graph[s]: 
				if visited[i] == False: 
					queue.append(i) 
					visited[i] = True
```

We keep doing the above till we go though the entire graph. CongratsðŸŽ‰! However, before you leave lets just use an illustrated example on how the code works:
