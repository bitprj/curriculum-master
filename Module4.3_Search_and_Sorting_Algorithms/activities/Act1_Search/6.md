This code is the code we use to test our DFS algorithm.  We initialize this graph with by writing :

```python
g = Graph() 
```

Furthermore, we add edges between nodes by the addEdge() function. The first argument is the node that we start the edge from and the second parameter is the node where we end the edge connection.

```python
g.addEdge(0, 1) 
g.addEdge(0, 2) 
g.addEdge(1, 2) 
g.addEdge(2, 0) 
g.addEdge(2, 3) 
g.addEdge(3, 3) 
```

Finally, we initialize the DFS algorithm by specifying which node start the algorithm from.

```python
print ("Following is Depth First Traversal"
				" (starting from vertex 2)") 
g.DFS(2) 
```

Here is graphical representation of what the above graph looks like in "theory":

Here is DFS implemented in Python:

The first line here gets something called a "defaultdict" from the collections library. A "defaultdict" is basically a dictionary data structure but instead of giving you an error when you try to access a key that doesn't exist: its makes it for you with a default value you pass in. <sup> **1**</sup>

```python
from collections import defaultdict 
```

Here we initialize the graph class. What you need to know is simple: the __init__ function is called when a new graph object is made. When it is called, it just attaches defaultdict to the object. 

```python
class Graph: 

	def __init__(self): 		
		self.graph = defaultdict(list)
```

Now lets turn our attention to addEdge (as seen above). What the following line basically means is: we create a function addEdge  that takes the starting node(u) and final node(v) and connects them via an edge. 



Programmatically, we store the u as the key in a dictionary and store all its connecting nodes in a list we can access through said key .It stores this edge in the defaultdict(which is attached to the graph object we made) we talked about earlier.

```python
	def addEdge(self,u,v): 
		self.graph[u].append(v)         
```

So, if I wanted to create a graph with 3 nodes(node 1,2,3) which are connected by one edge from 1 to 2 and 1 to 3, it would look like this:

DFS faintly resembles BFS, but there are couple of distinctions. Lets take a look.

So, if I wanted to create a graph with 3 nodes(node 1,2,3) which are connected by one edge from 1 to 2 and 1 to 3, it would look like this:

```python
	def DFS(self, v): 
		visited = [False] * (len(self.graph)) 
```

On the next line, you'll notice a call to a function called **"DFSUtil"**. 

```python
		self.DFSUtil(v, visited) 
```

DFSUtil is a recursive function that uses the function stack to save nodes for later use(as we move along our DFS traversal). 



This later use being: when the DFS traversal finds out that there are no more adjacent, unvisited nodes on its current path, it will pop back to the newest added node and try to find new paths. This continues till no nodes remain untouched.

Lets take look at DFSUtil in more tangible way now.

We get a starting node called v and we mark it as True. It also prints the node it just visited as well. 

```python
	def DFSUtil(self, v, visited): 
		visited[v] = True
		print(v, end = ' ') 
```

Check for all adjacent vertices. If they have not been visited, we call DFSUtil. 

```python
		for i in self.graph[v]: 
			if visited[i] == False: 
				self.DFSUtil(i, visited) 
```

Again,just as a review: lets take a look at an illustrated example:
