**Breadth-first search** (**BFS**) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

As in the example given above, the BFS algorithm starts at S and moves to A, B, and then C. Afterwards, it moves from A to D then B to E and then C to F. Finally it goes from D to G. *See a pattern?* The BFS algorithm inspects all adjacent nodes then goes to the next "level" of adjacent nodes (the nodes that are adjacent to the adjacent nodes...and so on until we go through the entire tree). 

BFS employs the following rules.

- **Rule 1** − Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it as visited. Display it. Insert it in a queue.
- **Rule 2** − If no adjacent vertex is found, remove the first vertex from the queue.
- **Rule 3** − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the queue is empty.

|  3   | <img src="https://i.ibb.co/tXRrNrF/Traversal-2.png"></img>  | Choose a node adjacent to S (node A) and mark it as visited and add it to the queue. |
