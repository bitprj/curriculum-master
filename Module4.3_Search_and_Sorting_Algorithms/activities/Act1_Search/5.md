**Depth First Search** (**DFS**) uses the opposite strategy as **Breadth-first search**. It is is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

As in the example given above, DFS algorithm traverses from S to A to D to G to E to B first, then to F and lastly to C. It employs the following rules.

- **Rule 1** − Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it as visited. Display it. Push it in a stack.

- **Rule 2** − If no adjacent vertex is found, pop up a vertex from the stack. (It will pop up all the vertices from the stack, which do not have adjacent vertices.)

- **Rule 3** − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the stack is empty.

  |  2   | ![img](https://i.ibb.co/0ZwGn9j/DFS-Traversal-1.png) |         Start from node S and mark it as "visited".          |
  |  3   | ![img](https://i.ibb.co/k5sh0Vg/DFS-Traversal-2.png) | Choose a node adjacent to S (node A) and mark it as visited and add it to the stack. |
  |  4   | ![img](https://i.ibb.co/HrMWFVm/DFS-Traversal-3.png) | Choose a node adjacent to A (node D) and mark it as visited and add it to the stack. |
  |  5   | ![img](https://i.ibb.co/0hVBr15/DFS-Traversal-4.png) | Choose a node adjacent to D (node B) and mark it as visited and add it to the queue. |
  |  6   | ![img](https://i.ibb.co/2s4032J/DFS-Traversal-5.png) | B doesn't have any unvisited adjacent nodes that we. We pop B out and look at D's nodes. |
  |  7   | ![img](https://i.ibb.co/ZBNdg2g/DFS-Traversal-6.png) | Choose a node adjacent to D (node C) and mark it as visited and add it to the stack. |
  |  8   |   ![](https://i.ibb.co/V30g8VV/DFS-Traversal.png)    | We pop out C from our stack and find that there no unvisited nodes near it. We move on. |
  |  9   |  ![](https://i.ibb.co/VN01Tb0/DFS-Traversal-1.png)   | We pop out D from our stack and find that there no unvisited nodes near it. We move on. |
  |  10  |  ![](https://i.ibb.co/6nQwWC4/DFS-Traversal-2.png)   | We pop out A from our stack and find that there no unvisited nodes near it. We move on. |
  |  11  |  ![](https://i.ibb.co/xs6WFfg/DFS-Traversal-3.png)   | We pop out S from our stack and find that there no unvisited nodes near it. We move on. We are done! |
