**Introduction to Search Algorithms:** Let's say you have a huge collection of comic books and one day you feel like reading a specific comic book out of your collection. You have to *search* through your collection to find the comic book you want. 

If your bookshelves is sorted alphabetically, you can just look at the place where similarly named comics are. Or you can go one by one, looking through each comic on the shelf. As you can see your searching method depends on what you are exactly searching for and where this item is housed. These factors also help you choose certain sorting/searching algorithms in the "real world".

Here we have illustrated the core idea behind search algorithms: we have a collection of data(with both shared and unique traits) and we want to find a unique element or group of elements in this collection. 

Here will we go over a couple of types of search algorithms ,namely: Breadth-first Search, Depth-first Search, and Binary search.

Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.

##### How Binary Search Works?

For a binary search to work, it is mandatory for the target array to be sorted. We shall learn the process of binary search with a pictorial example. The following is our sorted array and let us assume that we need to search the location of value 44 using binary search.

First, we shall determine half of the array by using this formula âˆ’

```
mid = low + (high - low) / 2
```

Here it is, 0 + (9 - 0 ) / 2 = 4 (integer value of 4.5). So, 4 is the mid of the array.

![binary_search_1](https://i.ibb.co/Bch3qM7/Array-Base-1.png)

Now we compare the value stored at location 4, with the value being searched, i.e. 44. We find that the value at location 4 is 32, which is not a match. As the value is greater than 32 and we have a sorted array, so we also know that the target value must be in the upper portion of the array.

Hence, we calculate the mid again. This time it is 5.

![binary_search_5](https://i.ibb.co/fN4GPQY/Array-Base-3.png)

We compare the value stored at location 5 with our target value. We find that it is a match.

We conclude that the target value 44 is stored at location 5.

Binary search halves the searchable items and thus reduces the count of comparisons to be made to very less numbers.
