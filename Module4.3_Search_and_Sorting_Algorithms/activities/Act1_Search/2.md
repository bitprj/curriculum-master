We start with the following sorted list and our target is 10.

```python
arr = [ 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 ] 
x = 10
```

We make the call to the aptly named binarySearch function(and initialize it with the necessary parameters). We will get into the nitty gritty of the implementation but right now you should just know that we are just giving the function the entire arr list without any cuts or omissions.

```python
# Function call 
result = binarySearch(arr, 0, len(arr)-1, x) 
```

Finally we display the results of our search!

```python
if result != -1: 
	print "Element is present at index % d" % result 
else: 
	print "Element is not present in array"
```



Now lets take a look at the binary search implementation in Python:

We start with the function declaration and we send in the start index(l), end index(r) and the target value(x) into the function.

```python
def binarySearch (arr, l, r, x): 
```

Next,  we write the code that find the middle of our current list and makes sure we don't mess around with lists smaller than 1(i.e empty arrays/lists).

```
	if r >= l: 
		mid = l + (r - l)/2
```

Now, we have three cases:

* The middle of our list contains the target value

```
 		if arr[mid] == x: 
			return mid 
```

For example let's say the target in the following list is 44. Our middle index(which is 5) gives us is exactly that!

* The target value is in the upper part of the list. So we cut it up accordingly and try running the function again with the newly adjusted (upper) list!

```
		elif arr[mid] < x: 
			return binarySearch(arr, mid+1, r, x) 

```

For example let's say the target in the following list is 49. It is located in the upper part of the sorted list, so we cut from the middle on to the end accordingly!

* The target value is in the lower part of the list. So we cut it up accordingly and try running the function again with the newly adjusted (lower) list!

```
      else: 
			return binarySearch(arr, l, mid - 1, x) 
```

For example let's say the target in the following list is 18. It is located in the lower part of the sorted list, so we cut from the start up to (but just before )middle accordingly!

If we find that we have "eaten" up the entire list and still haven't found the target value(as the more we cut up the list to find the target value: the smaller it gets). We tell the user that the value doesn't exist!

```
	else: 
		return -1
```

Just as a sanity check, here is how the list we talked about earlier(with the target 10) would run:
