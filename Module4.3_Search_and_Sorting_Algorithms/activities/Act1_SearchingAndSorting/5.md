Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.

##### How Binary Search Works?

For a binary search to work, it is mandatory for the target array to be sorted. We shall learn the process of binary search with a pictorial example. The following is our sorted array and let us assume that we need to search the location of value 25 using binary search.

First, we shall determine half of the array by using this formula âˆ’

```
mid = low + (high - low) / 2
```

Here it is, 0 + (9 - 0 ) / 2 = 4 (integer value of 4.5). So, 4 is the mid of the array.

Now we compare the value stored at location 4, with the value being searched, i.e. 25. We find that the value at location 4 is 24, which is not a match. As the value is greater than 24 and we have a sorted array, so we also know that the target value must be in the upper portion of the array.

We will find the mid again and determine it to be 5 + (9-5) / 2 = 7. Since the value at location 7 is 41, we know that the target value should be in the lower portion of the remaining array (at an index less than 7, but greater than 4).

Hence, we calculate the mid again. This time it is 5.

We compare the value stored at location 5 with our target value. We find that it is a match.

We conclude that the target value 25 is stored at location 5.

Binary search halves the searchable items and thus reduces the count of comparisons to be made to very less numbers.
