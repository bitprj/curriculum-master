**The Importance of Searching**

Searching for elements in a data structure is a key concept in computer science. The applications are endless! 

Suppose, for example, I love watching movies. I have collections of all of the *Harry Potter*, *The Lord of the Rings*, and *James Bond* films. I have invited some friends to binge-watch them with me tomorrow morning, but I woke up late and need to find the movies quickly! How can I find the movies that I want to watch in the most efficient manner possible, before the doorbell rings?

Now extend this problem to wide-scale computer systems. I need to find certain information (say, for example, medical records) from my stored data in a timely fashion. What sort of algorithms should I implement? Luckily, Computer Scientists have developed answers for us!

**Breadth-first search** (**BFS**) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

As in the example given above, BFS algorithm starts at S, traverses to A, B, and C (the first layer), then traverses to D, E, and F (second layer), and then finally to G (third layer). More formally, BFS employs the following rules.

- **Rule 1** − Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it as visited. Display it. Insert it in a queue.
- **Rule 2** − If no adjacent vertex is found, remove the first vertex from the queue.
- **Rule 3** − Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the queue is empty.
