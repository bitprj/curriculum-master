Although you can assign values like "word" and 10 to **variables**. There are names for these different **data types**.
There are **primitive data types** (the most basic) and **non-primitive types** (built using primitive types).

Primitive Data types:
1. **Boolean** types are either `True` or `False` (1 **bit**)

   ```python
   school_cancel = True
   ```

2. **Float** types are numbers with decimals (4 **bytes**)

   ```python
   temperature = 49.5
   ```

3. **String** types are in quotation marks (Each element is 1 **byte**)

   ```python
   my_car = "Toyota"
   ```

4. **Integer** types are numbers (4 **bytes**)

   ```python
   book_num = 1300
   ```

   

Non-primitive Data types:
1. **Tuples**

   Tuples are enclosed by parentheses. For example,

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1,"hi",2.5)
   ```

2. **List**

   Lists are enclosed by brackets. For example,

   ```python
   my_list = [1,"hi",2.5]
   ```

3. **Dictionary**

   Dictionaries are enclosed by braces. For example,

   ```python
   my_dict = {"name":"myCar", "brand":"Toyota", "year":2020}
   ```

   

You can check the type of a variable using `type()`. Use it on the number 10
```python
>>> type(10)
<class 'int'>
```
It shows that 10 is an **integer**.
Now do it for "10"

```python
>>> type("10")
<class 'str'>
```
It shows that "10" is a **string** because it is in quotes.

Let's try it with a math equation like 10 + 20.
```python
>>> type(10 + 20)
<class 'int'>
```
We see there is no "equation" type, because Python evaluates that expression first, which becomes a single number or **integer**.
