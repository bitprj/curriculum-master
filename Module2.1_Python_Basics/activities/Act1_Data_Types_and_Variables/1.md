Python is a simple and straightforward programming language that is very readable and understandable for people. 

For example, the following code

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

simply prints out the line `Hello, world!` on our screen when we run it in python. The built-in function `print()` would simply prints out whatever is in the parenthesis.
