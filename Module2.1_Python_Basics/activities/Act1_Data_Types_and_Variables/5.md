You can also do a **chained assignment** to create two variables at once using two equal signs. For example, when we type this line into the command line,

```python
>>> var1 = var2 = "At the park"
```

the variables `var1` and `var2` both hold the **string** "At the park".

We can stretch this out with more chains.

```python
>>> var4 = 10
>>> var1 = var2 = var3 = var4
```

All those four variables have the **integer** 10.

With **chained assignment**, we can make our code more compact for assignments.
