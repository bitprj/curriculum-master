Variables are like boxes, where you can store one thing inside them for use later on. (On the other hand, data structures are likes boxes that grow in size, allowing you to add more and more items).

When you want to store data for use later on, you put it into a **variable**.

To create a **variable**, you just type a word (the name of your variable) and set it equal to something else (even another variable).

```python
>>> result = 5 + 10 - 2 * 3
```

`result` holds the value 9 after this.

What happened here is:

1. The right hand side of the equals sign is computed
2. The left hand side of the equals sign is assigned with the value on the right hand side

in that order.

When naming your variables, there are rules to follow, though. Names:

- May start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore _
- May have letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers, or underscores for the other parts of the name
- Are case sensitive (So APPLE, apple, and APPLe are recognized as different variables)

In programming, you generally name your variables following one of these two naming conventions:

1. Underscores
2. Camel case

Python follows the first one.

To use underscores, just add `_` instead of space whenever a variable name has two or more words.

* even_numbers
* past_events
* food_list
* word_dict

Camel case capitalizes the second and subsequent words in a variable name and keeps all other letters lowercase.

* evenNumbers
* pastEvents
* foodList
* wordDict

Remember, when naming your variables, the goal is to choose variable names that makes your code easier to read and understand because helpful variable names go a long way towards your and others' understanding of your code.
