When we print variables, we can print them by putting them in the parenthesis of `print()`.
Let's put a **string** "1234" into a variable `numStr` and an **integer** 1234 into a variable called `numInt`.

```python
>>> numStr = "1234"
>>> numInt = 1234
```
We can then print both of them out with `print()`
```python
>>> print(numStr)
1234
>>> print(numInt)
1234
```
Although the output looks the same, their types are not.
The first is a **string** and the second is an **integer**.
To see the difference, you can print a **concatenation** with "5678" using +
Do this for `numStr` first

```python
>>> print(numStr + "5678")
12345678
```
Now do this for `numInt`
```python
>>> print(numInt + "5678") # what will happen?
```
The types are different. `numInt` is a different type from "5678" despite it LOOKS the same as 5678. Python does not allow this and spits an error out at you. We will learn how to add strings and numbers together later!
