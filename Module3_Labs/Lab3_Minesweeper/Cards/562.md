## Code to Print Out Row Headers and Cell Contents

### Step 1: Row Iteration

To output each row, we will have to iterate through `self`. However we also want to print the associated `row_id` with each row, and we can do that by using `enumerate(self)` to get a tuple of a count associated with the row. 

```python
for (row_id, row) in enumerate(self):
```

### Step 2: Printing each `row` number

We'll first print a newline and then the `row_id`, properly spaced:

```python
"\n" + str(row_id) + " "
```

Make sure you are doing this at the end of each row as well.

### Step 3: Printing each row's contents

We want to iterate through all the columns to get each cell object individually. After finding an individual `Cell`, we can use `mine_repr` to print each cell. Then we can use the built-in `join` function to put all of the characters together in one string for each row. 

```python
     "".join(self.mine_repr(row_id, col_id) 
             for (col_id, _) in enumerate(row)) 
```

We use `enumerate(row)` to just get a `col_id`, we won't actually do anything with the contents of the row. 

### Step 4: Code

```python
for (row_id, row) in enumerate(self):
    board_string += ("\n" + str(row_id) + " " +
                     "".join(self.mine_repr(row_id, col_id)
                             for (col_id, _) in enumerate(row)) + " " + str(row_id))
```

You should prepend remaining mines and column headers to this string.
