## show(): Showing Tiles with no neighboring mines using Recursion

### Step 1: Set-up

How do we check if there are zero surrounding mines? We can use our helper `count_surrounding` to check if there are zero adjacent mines.

### Step 2: What to do

If there are no surrounding mines then we want to show all of this tile's neighbors. Use `get_neighbors` to obtain all the neighbors of this tile.

### Step 3: Out of bounds Handling

Depending on how you implemented `get_neighbors` previously, you may have to run `is_in_range` on each neighbor to ensure all your neighbors actually exist within the grid.

### Step 4: Handling Each Valid Neighbor

Now for each valid neighbor, we want to show it on the board, so we just recursively run the `show()` function on each neighbor. Given that we want to show the cell with the surrounding coordinates in the board, which `show()` should you use: `Cell` or `Board`?
