## `get_neighbors` Explained

### Step 1: What are the surrounding cells?

We want to find all 8 of the surrounding cells given a cell's row and column. We can define a tuple or list called `SURROUNDING` that stores the 8 sets of coordinates which define the relationship between the neighbors and a cell.

### Step 2: A SURROUNDING list?

For example, the cell directly to the north is the cell in the same column but the previous row (-1), therefore the coordinates for the north direction are (-1, 0).

### Step 3: Using `SURROUNDING`

For each set of coordinates in `SURROUNDING`, add them to the given row and column to generate a tuple or list of coordinates. Return that list to return the surrounding coordinates.
