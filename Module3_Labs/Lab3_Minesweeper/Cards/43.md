## `remaining_mines` Explained

### Step 1: Finding the cell given `self`

Remember `self` represents the tuple of cells themselves in a 2D array. Therefore you can iterate through each row using `for row in self:` directly.

### Step 2: Using the Cell

After finding the `row` and then iterating through the row to find each cell, you can check if a cell is a mine or if a cell is flagged using `cell.is_mine` and `cell.is_flagged`. What should you do if a cell is a mine versus if a cell is flagged?

### Step 3: Return remaining mines

Make sure you return the number of remaining mines (# of mines - # of flags used) when done.
