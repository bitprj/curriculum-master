## Instance Variables

### Step 1: How to Use Instance Variables

In the constructor of our `Cell` class, we will store whether the cell is visible, flagged or is a mine. Therefore we have to add all those properties as **instance variables**.

### Step 2: Naming your Instance Variables

We recommend adding instance variables to your class with the following variable names: 

- `is_mine`  (indicates that the cell is a mine)
- `is_visible`  (indicates that the cell has been selected by the user and is visible; by default, this attribute is **false**)  
- `is_flagged`  (indicates that the cell has been flagged by the user; by default, this attribute is **false**)
