## Flagging cells using `flag()`

### Step 1: Obtain the cell with given row and col

Because we are changing the `is_flagged` property of one cell, we need to obtain that one `Cell` object to act on. How could we do that?

### Step 2: What cells can we flag?

Bear in mind that we can only flag **non-visible cells**. If the player is trying to flag a visible cell, there should be an error printed to the console.

### Step 3: How to actually flag the cell?

We have already implemented this functionality in the `Cell` class...
