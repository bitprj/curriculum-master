## `is_solved` Code

### Step 1: Set-Up

We need to designate `is_solved(self)` with a `@property` decorator:

```python
@property
def is_solved(self):
    solved = True
```

### Step 2: Iteration

We set up iteration through each cell:

```python
	for row in self:
    	for cell in row:      
```

### Step 3: Handling Visibility and Mines

If there exists one cell that is not visible and is not a mine, then the game has not been solved.

```python
        if (cell.is_visible or cell.is_mine):
            continue
        else:
            solved = False      
	return solved
```
### Step 4: Solution 

Here is the full solution:

```python
@property
def is_solved(self):
    solved = True
    for row in self:
    	for cell in row:  
            if (cell.is_visible or cell.is_mine):
            	continue
       		else:
            	solved = False      
	return solved
```

### Step 5: Compact Solution 

Here is an alterative, more compact solution using the `all` keyword:

```python
@property
def is_solved(self):
    return all((cell.is_visible or cell.is_mine) for row in self for cell in row)	
```
