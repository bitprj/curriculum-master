## `get_move` Code

### Step 1: Initial Prompt

We use `input` in the following manner to initially prompt the user:

```python
move = input("Enter your move (for help enter \"H\"): ")
if move == "H":
    move = input(INSTRUCTIONS)
```

We also handle the "H" case right away.

### Step 2: While input is not valid

We can use a *while loop* to continuously prompt the user if input is not valid. Additionally, we already have coded our `is_valid` function that we can directly use here!

```python
    while not is_valid(move, board):
        move = input("Invalid input. Enter your move (for help enter \"H\"): ")
        if move == "H":
            move = input(INSTRUCTIONS)
```

Note that we also handle the "H" case here, otherwise the user can input misvalid input and then input "H" without getting their instructions.

### Step 3: Return a Tuple

We need to return a three-element tuple consisting of the row number, col number and a boolean containing whether the move flags or not.

```python
    return (int(move[1]), int(move[0]), move[-1] == "f")
```

Don't forget to type cast!

### Step 4: Solution

Here is the entire solution for `get_move`:

```python
def get_move(board):
    INSTRUCTIONS = ("First, enter the column, followed by the row. To add or remove a flag, add \"f\" after the row (for example, 64f would place a flag on the 6th column, 4th row). Enter your move: ")

    move = input("Enter your move (for help enter \"H\"):")
    if move == "H":
        move = input(INSTRUCTIONS)

    while not is_valid(move, board):
        move = input("Invalid input. Enter your move (for help enter \"H\"): ")
        if move == "H":
            move = input(INSTRUCTIONS)

    return (int(move[1]), int(move[0]), move[-1] == "f")
```
