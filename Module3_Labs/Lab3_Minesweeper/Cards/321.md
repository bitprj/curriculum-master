## Setters of the Cell class Explained

### Step 1: Setter Syntax

```python
def setter_name(self):
    # insert your setter implementation here
```

Each setter takes in a `self` as an argument. `self` refers to a specific instance of our class and under the hood, it ensures that we are calling the method on the correct instance of our class. 

Therefore, whenever we create methods inside our class, we must pass in `self`. 

### Step 2: show() Setter

We execute the `show()` setter whenever we want to make a tile **visible**, therefore all we have to do is set the `is_visible` instance variable of `self` to True. 

```python
def show(self):    
    self.is_visible = True
```

Note that we don't need a setter for the other way around - if a tile is visible it cannot become invisible!

### Step 3: flag() Setter

The `flag()` setter is run whenever the user wants to flag/unflag a tile. We just have to invert `self.is_flagged`: 

```python
def flag(self):
    self.is_flagged = not self.is_flagged
```

Note that the `not` keyword inverts variables.

### Step 4: place_mine() Setter

The `place_mine()` setter is run to indicate that this tile has a mine. We just have to set `self.is_mine` to `True`:

```python
def place_mine(self):
    self.is_mine = True
```
