## Code to Print Out Remaining Mines & Column Headers

### Step 1: Number of Remaining Mines

We can use `self.remaining_mines` to compute the number of remaining mines on the board. Remember `remaining_mines` has a `@property` decorator so we can use it as a property of our `Board` object! 

```python
"Mines: " + str(self.remaining_mines) + "\n  " +
```

Remember we are returning one string so we add a new line at the end for the sake of clean output.

### Step 2: Printing out Columns

`len(self[0])` will give us the number of columns. We simply iterate through the list of 0, 1, ..., `len(self[0])` and print the string version of each number to print out the columns:

```python
"".join([str(i) for i in range(len(self[0]))])
```

Make sure to do this at the end as well. 

### Step 3: Code

```python
board_string = ("Mines: " + str(self.remaining_mines) + "\n  " +                "".join([str(i) for i in range(len(self[0]))]))
```

You should append row headers and row content to this string.
