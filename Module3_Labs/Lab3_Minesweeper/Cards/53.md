## `mine_repr()`: What should be printed for each tile?

### Step 1: The possibilities to account for

There are four possibilities:

* Visible but a mine -> "M"
* Flagged -> "F"
* Not visible -> "X"
* Visible but not a mine -> number indicating amount of adjacent mines

### Step 2: Handling those possibilities

To handle each of those possibilties, a simple if conditional with the corresponding `Cell` attributes should suffice to handle your "M", "F" and "X" cases.

### Step 3: Handling visible non-mine cells

If a cell is visible and not a mine, we should use our helper `count_surrounding` to calculate the number of surrounding mines. Make sure you handle the case when there are no surrounding mines!

Lastly, make sure you return only one character or number.
