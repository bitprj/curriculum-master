## `is_solved`: How to determine winning

### Step 1: Win Conditions

When has the player won a game of Minesweeper? When the player has *made all non-mine cells visible* and all the *mine cells are not visible*.

### Step 2: What does this mean?

Therefore, in our code, whenever every cell is visible or a mine, then that means our game is "solved" and we should return `True` in that scenario. Don't forget the `@property` decorator!
