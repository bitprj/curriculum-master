### Code for showing tiles with no adjacent mines

### Step 1: How to check for no adjacent mines

We use the `count_surrounding` helper to check if there are no adjacent mines:

```python
# note that this continues from the previous code
elif self.count_surrounding(row_id, col_id) == 0:
```



### Step 2: Showing Neighbors - Iteration

We can iterate through all possible neighbors using `self.get_neighbors`:

```python
	for (surr_row, surr_col) in self.get_neighbors(row_id, col_id):
```

### Step 3: Checking if a neighbor is in range before showing

For each neighbor, we use the `is_in_range` helper to check if each neighbor is in range:

```python
		if self.is_in_range(surr_row, surr_col):
        	self.show(surr_row, surr_col)
```

### Step 4: Solution

Here is the entire solution, excluding code covered in other hints for the other visibility cases:

```python
    # code continues...        
    elif self.count_surrounding(row_id, col_id) == 0:
        for (surr_row, surr_col) in self.get_neighbours(row_id, col_id):
            if self.is_in_range(surr_row, surr_col):
                self.show(surr_row, surr_col)
```
