## Simple helpers: `is_in_range` and `place_mine`

### Step 1: `is_in_range`

Make sure your `row_id` and `col_id` are within range, i.e. there should be no negative rows/columns or any row/column that is greater than the number of rows and columns.

### Step 2: `place_mine`

Locate the cell at `(row_id, col_id)` and then place a mine there using the `Cell` class's `place_mine` function.
