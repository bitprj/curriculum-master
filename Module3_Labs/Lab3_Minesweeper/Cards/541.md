## Code for making a cell visible

### Step 1: Isolating the cell

We first can obtain the `Cell` object of interest with the following line:

```python
cell = self[row_id][col_id]
```

### Step 2: Meeting Conditions to show the cell

If the cell is not visible and not flagged, then we can show the cell by running the `show()` setter from `Cell`:

```python
if not (cell.is_visible or cell.is_flagged):
    cell.show()
```

### Step 3: Setting `is_playing`

The game is over when the cell is a mine, so we set `is_playing` to `False`.

```python
	if cell.is_mine:    
        self.is_playing = False
```

The case for handling tiles without surrounding mines is handled in another hint.

### Step 4: Solution (w/o no adjacent mine handling)

```python
def show(self, row_id, col_id):
    cell = self[row_id][col_id]
    if not (cell.is_visible or cell.is_flagged):
        cell.show()

        if cell.is_mine:
            self.is_playing = False
        elif # insert condition here
        	# insert rest of code here
```
