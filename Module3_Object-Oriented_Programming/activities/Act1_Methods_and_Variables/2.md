# How can we design our own class?

The following code below will explain how the Dog Class itself would be constructed

```python
class Dog:
    #Class Attribute
    species = "mammals"
    #Initializing Class Attributes
    def __init__(self,name,breed,tail_length,fur_style,physique):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
        self.tail_length = tail_length
        self.fur_style = fur_style
        self.physique = physique
        
    #Destructor Method that deletes all of the references regarding the dog object created
    def __del__(self):
        print("Destructor called, Dog object deleted.")
    
    #Class Method in which we know that dogs are a type of mammal that bark
    def bark(self):
        print(self.name + "says woof woof!")
        
    
    
    #Static Method that shows how dogs are canines and that this group is a type of mammal
    def get_candid():
        print("Dogs are Canines!")
        
#Stating the fact that dogs are Canines
Dog.get_candid()

#Example of instatiating a Dog object
fido = Dog("Fido","Toy Fox Terrier",3,"short","slim")

#Accessing the Instance Attributes 
print("{} is a {} ,whose tail length is {} inches, has {} fur, and is very {}.".format(fido.name, fido.breed, fido.tail_length, fido.fur_style, fido.physique))

#Checking if Fido is a mammal
if fido.species == "mammal":
    print("{0} is a {1}!".format(fido.name,fido.species))
    
#Showing how Fido can bark as a dog
fido.bark()

#Deleting Fido as a dog object
del fido

```



So I see that you're now reading this code and thinking, "What the heck does this all mean?" Well to break down the down what each part of the code does, they all have a strong role to play for defining how the dog constructor is supposed to work. You're now probably asking, "What's a constructor?" The answer to that is that a constructor is a very important method in a class that actually initializes an object's attributes for all objects within that group. An example for what the general syntax of what a constructor should look like, we'll be basing this off of the Dog Class that was created earlier.

```python
    #Initializing Class Attributes
    def __init__(self,name,breed,tail_length,fur_style,physique):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
        self.tail_length = tail_length
        self.fur_style = fur_style
        self.physique = physique
```

We see here that the general form of the syntax is always `def __init__(self,parameter_n1,parameter_n2)` in which the `__init__()` function sets up the initialization of what the attributes of an object would be assigned to and these are always assigned to the first parameter `self`. The `self` parameter  is the actual instance of the class itself. This would mean that based on this portion of the Dog Class from previously, the "self" parameter is a reference towards the dog that we're creating. Another thing to note about the parameter after the `self` parameter (name, breed, etc...), those parameters represent the attributes that we're going to assign our instance to for the features that the object should have. You can have as many parameters as you want for any class that you're making. Now if you also see right in the body of the constructor call, you always see this little dot (.) that always connects self with the parameter name (`self.name, self.breed`, etc...). The dot operator serves the purpose of assigning the actual attributes in our parameter in the function call with our instance (self). This would mean that "self.name" would give the dog it's, `self.breed` would tell us what breed the dog actually is, etc...

Another important aspect of a class would be methods. A method is a specific programmed procedure that's already defined within the class and also towards the objects in that class. In terms of the 3 important methods that you should know, you should definitely be aware of Class, Destructor, and Static methods. A Class method is a method that's bounded specifically towards the class and not the objects. This would mean that the Class method would already be a defined function within our blueprint that all objects should share no matter the type. Here's an example of the class method below from our Dog Class.

```python
 #Class Method in which we know that dogs are a type of mammal that bark
    def bark(self):
        print(self.name + "says woof woof!")
       
```

We can see here that the class method in this case is that we should all know that dogs have the ability to bark, so this would mean that it shouldn't matter what breed of dog that you can have, they all would innately have this trait within them.

Another important method is the Static method, which is a method that is a defined member of the object that's directly accessible from an object's constructor naturally instead of an instance that was created for the class. An example of this can be given down below from our Dog Class.

```python
  #Static Method that shows how dogs are canines and that this group is a type of mammal
    def get_candid():
        print("Dogs are Canines!")
```

We can see here that it's a given trait that all dogs are supposed to be canines, so this would mean that there wouldn't need to be an attribute to differentiate many breeds of dogs since all dogs are known to be this type of mammal.

Last, but not least, the Destructor method is basically the deletion of the object we have actually created.  An example of this can be given below from our Dog Class.

```python
#Destructor Method that deletes all of the references regarding the dog object created
    def __del__(self):
        print("Destructor called, Dog object deleted.")
```

We would then see that once you have built a dog object, the dog itself would be completely erased from existence once you call the `del` function. This would then give another opportunity to create another dog (object) of your choice and you can change attributes of your new dog by your choosing.

Now after reading all of these wonderful descriptions of the ins and outs of a constructor, you're probably wondering, "That's cool and all, but I want to see how they can be used." Well you're in the right place because these are the examples for you. An example for how the constructor works is that we will be creating a dog named Fido and we will define his breed, length of his tail, the type of fur that it has, and its physique. Here is the example down below.

```python
##Example of Constructor Application on Fido

#Example of instatiating a Dog object
fido = Dog("Fido","Toy Fox Terrier",3,"short","slim")

#Accessing the Instance Attributes 
print("{} is a {} ,whose tail length is {} inches, has {} fur, and is very {}.".format(fido.name, fido.breed, fido.tail_length, fido.fur_style, fido.physique))
```

Another example would be applying the class method would be towards giving Fido the innate ability to bark because all dogs no matter what breed should naturally have this ability. Here is the example down below.

```python
##Example of Class Method on Fido

#Showing how Fido can bark as a dog
fido.bark()
```

Another example would be showing how the Static method explains all dogs (including Fido) have a common trait of being the same type of mammal, which we call Canines. No matter what breed of dog that we have, they're always going to be within the same group of being this type of mammal. Here is the example down below.

```python
##Example of Static Method on Fido

#Static Method that shows how dogs are canines and that this group is a type of mammal
    def get_candid():
        print("Dogs are Canines!")
```

A final, but sad example is that we're going to have to use the Destructor method to say goodbye to our friend Fido. Here is the example down below.

```python
##Example of Destructor Method on Fido

#Deleting Fido as a dog object
del fido
```

If you're more curious about how to apply these methods to other objects in the same group, we can refer back to the picture of dogs that we had earlier. We mentioned how an instance would always have a set of defined attributes that's common with all objects in that class. However, you can differentiate different types of objects within the same group based on the variance of the type of attributes that they all share. An example could be based on the picture below. We see here that all of these animals would match the dog class because they all have 4 legs, have tails, are known to be mammals since they're warm blooded, and are known to be canines. However, these dogs tend to differentiate from each other based on their fur structure, breed, tail length, and their physique. For example, we can see here that the Pomeranian and the Yorkshire Terrier are both dogs due to them matching the given definitions based on our dog class and both are extremely hairy, but we can see here is that the Pomeranian has fur that tends to be combed out at an angle whereas the Yorkshire Terrier has fur that's drooping downwards; also, these are 2 different breeds of a dog. We can then say that the instance of our class could be about what kind of breed the dog is and the variance of the common physical feature that all of the dogs share. This concept can also be applied to dogs of the same breed, but they're a different kind of breed. An example would be that we know that the Silky Terrier and the Toy Fox Terrier are both a breed of Terrier since what all of the Terriers have in common is that they're fairly slim, have pointed ears upwards, and have short tails, but the Silky Terrier is much hairier than the Toy Fox Terrier.
