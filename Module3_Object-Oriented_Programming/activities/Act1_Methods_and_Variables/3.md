# Activity: Pywitter

Let's create a social platform for all programmers! We can first create a class to define a `PywitterUser`.

So what the PywitterUser class represents is that it's supposed to be a class that blueprints how the user is supposed to interact with Twitter as a social media platform. Now you're probably thinking, "Why exactly do we want to make this into a class?" The answer to that would be you would get to see how a social media platform works in which you get top see how there's an inate set of actions that the app is supposed to do (send a tweet, follow another user, check number of followers, and create your actual username for the platform) and the methods of using the app could change based on either updates that the developer has decided for the set attributes of the app or they could develop a new social media app that uses additional actions for the apps attributes.

**We must specify three components of our class: attributes, methods, and constructor.** 

1. **Attributes - What subvariables make up this new data type?**

- Username (string)
- Tweets (list of strings)
- Followers (list of other Pywitter users)

2. **Methods - What do we want our new data type to do?** 

- Tweet a tweet
- Follow a user

3. **Constructor - What should happen when we make a new instance of our new data type?** 

- User should provide a username. (`Pywitter(username)`)

Below is how we create a constructor of a class:

```python
# Rule: whenever we create methods inside our class, we must pass in self
# self refers to a specific instance of our class and under the hood, it ensures that we are calling the method on the correct instance of our class. 
def __init__(self):
   <statement>
```

To reiterate what the `__init__()` function does in the code is that it is the constructor that sets up the creation of the object and what the object's attributes are to it. The parameters within the `__init__()` function would always have the first parameter `self`, which is the actual object we're creating, and additional parametters after that are the actual attributes for the class. If we wanted to imitialize the actual values of any given class, we would write `self.insert_attribute_parameter_name_here =insert_attribute_parameter_name_here ` to ensure that the attribute that you would call in your construtor call belongs to the object you're creating.



Let's build our `PywitterUser` class by first creating a **constructor** and defining the class's **attributes** inside of it:

```python
class PywitterUser:   
	# constructor 
    # username is the parameter for our constructor
    def __init__(self, username): 
        # atrributes
        # create and initialize the default attributes for the 	  instance of the class
        self.username = username # assigns what the user passes in as username to the attribute username in the class
        self.tweets = [] # by default, tweets is an empty array
        self.followers = []
```

Now you're probably wondering about how you can actually initiiate the constructor to call. What you would do is create a variable name and set that equal to the class name with the parameters of the attributes from the `__init__()` call. An example would be that lets say that we want to create a twitter account for a person named Rachel. What we would do is pass in the `PywitterUser()` class call and we would write in the perspective attribute calls based on the type of datatype that they are. In this case, we would pass in strings except for the `followers` parameter for the function call since the only attribute that's numerical is the `followers` parameter since we're trying to track how many followers does Rachel have.

 To **instantiate** a `PywitterUser` **object**: 

```python
Rachel = PywitterUser("rachelPython4ever","Python is the best!")
```

In the example above, `rachelPython4ever` is passed in as `username` and stored into the `username` attribute of the `Rachel` object of `PywitterUser` data type. 

Let's continue to define the methods that a  `PywitterUser` can do:

```python
class PywitterUser: 
    def __init__(self, username): 
        self.username = username 
        self.tweets = [] 
        self.followers = []
        
    # REMEMBER: all methods, including the constructor, has to  take in self as a paramter or one of the parameter
   	def tweet (self, content):
        <code that will post a tweet>
        
    def follow (self, username):
        <code that will follow another user>
```

## Summary

```python
class PywitterUser: 
    # constructor
    def __init__(self, username): 
        # attributes 
        self.username = username 
        self.tweets = [] 
        self.followers = []
 	
    # methods
   	def tweet (self, content):
        <code that will post a tweet>
        
    def follow (self, username):
        <code that will follow another user>
```
