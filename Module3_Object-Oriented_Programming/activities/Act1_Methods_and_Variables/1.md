# Object-Oriented Programming

**Object-oriented programming** (or **OOP**) is a model for writing computer programs in which programmers solve problems by creating and using **objects**. 

Built-in data types in Python include integers, strings, Booleans, floats, and etc., but with **classes**, we have the power to define our own data types! 

**Classes** are the blueprints of objects, meaning that they define what data or **variables** does the objects hold and what methods or **functions** can the objects do. Let's say that we wanted to make a dog class. We can set up a blueprint in which that we know dogs are organisms that are actually animals. We have now established that a dog is supposed to be defined as an animal, but we don't have a set of rules for what kind of animal that it should be .

An instance can be seen as a class , but with defined instructions for what the class actually should be. This would mean that a class would no longer be a concept, but rather an existing object that many people can see and understand. Going back to the dog class, we know that the dog itself is supposed to be an actual animal, but how do we know what type of animal it is and what makes it stand out from the rest of the animals? We would then write a set of instructions for how dogs are supposed to behave and what would the physical features of the dogs look like. We know that the most common traits that we see in a dog is that they have fur, have 4 legs, have tails, are mammals, and are canines. We would then define these attributes in our class to explain what a dog really is.
