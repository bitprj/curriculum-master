Let's create a simple menu! 

We'll name the program menu.py and it will be a simple menu that is repeatedly printed out until you type "exit". Anything else you type will cause the menu to print itself again.

This culminating activity will have two parts to it.

**Part 1 will focus primarily on:**

`for loops`

`while loops`

**Part 2 will focus  primarily on:**

`if-elif-else statements`



Here is how the finished program for part 1 will look:

```
>>> menu()
Here is your list of options! Type "exit" to exit
Watch tv
Go to the park
Take out the trash
Hello World

Here is your list of options! Type "exit" to exit
Watch tv
Go to the park
Take out the trash
ex

Here is your list of options! Type "exit" to exit
Watch tv
Go to the park
Take out the trash
exit
Goodbye!

```
