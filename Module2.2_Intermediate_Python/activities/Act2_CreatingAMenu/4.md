Here is our infinite loop from before:

```python
while (True):
    print("Here is your list of options! Type \"exit\" to exit")
    options = ["Watch tv", "Go to the park", "Take out the trash"]
		for option in options:
    		print(option)
```

How are we going to break out of it?

Lets look back at the prompt to see how we exit the loop. The loop will exit once the user types "exit", so we need to obtain user input. How can we get the computer to prompt for this user input? Python does this by using `input()`. 

But where should we place the `input()`? Before the while loop? In the while loop but before the for loop? In the while loop but after the for loop? 

Because the menu prints out at least once, we want to get user input after the first round of printing is done. We also want the input to be prompted everytime we print the list. Therefore, `input()` should go inside the **while loop** but after and outside the **for loop**. We should also assign `input()` to a variable so we can store the user input. Your code should look something like this: 

```python
while (True):
    print("Here is your list of options! Type \"exit\" to exit")
    options = ["Watch tv", "Go to the park", "Take out the trash"]
		for option in options:
    	print(option)
    userIn = input()
```

Right now, even though we took in the user input, your code is still stuck in an infinite loop. The next step is to actually check if the user typed in "exit", if not the while loop would continue. We can add an `if` **statement** to do so. We want our if statment to **break** out the **while loop** only if the input is equal to "exit" because only then will our stated condition would be satisfied. Let's add this to the code and take a look!

```python
while (True):
    print("Here is your list of options! Type \"exit\" to exit")
    options = ["Watch tv", "Go to the park", "Take out the trash"]
		for option in options:
    		print(option)
    userIn = input()
    if (userIn == "exit"):
        break
```

Our program is almost done! When the user types "exit", the **break** statement will run since the if statement results in  `True`. 

To finish things off, we have to print "Goodbye!". Since we only want "Goodbye" to be printed once after the menu stops reprinting, we must add the print statement outside and after the **while loop**. Make sure it is indented to the same place as the **while condition**!

```python
while (True):
    print("Here is your list of options! Type \"exit\" to exit")
    options = ["Watch tv", "Go to the park", "Take out the trash"]
		for option in options:
    		print(option)
    userIn = input()
    if (userIn == "exit"):
        break
print("Goodbye!")
```

Although this program will run without error, it is important to note that 

` options = ["Watch tv", "Go to the park", "Take out the trash"]`

will run every iteration of the loop. However, `options` stays the same with every loop so it would make more sense to put it before the while loop to make the code more efficient, so lets make this quick change.

At this point your final code for part 1 should look something like this: 

```python
options = ["Watch tv", "Go to the park", "Take out the trash"]
while (True):
    print("Here is your list of options! Type \"exit\" to exit")
    for option in options:
        print(option)
    userIn = input()
    if (userIn == "exit"):
        break
print("Goodbye!")
```



Congratulations! You finished part 1!

Here's a flow chart going over a the layout of a simpified version of our program. You can see that the **for loop** is always fully executed whenever the **while loop** condition is `True`, which in our program it always is because we set it to that. After the **for loop** finishes running we take the user input and evaluate it with the `if` statment. If the input is not equal to (`!=` ) "exit", the code in the the while loop starts over as the loop iterates once more. If the input is equal (` ==`) to "exit", the computer enters the if statment and executes `break` which breaks out of the **while loop** and the program prints "Goodbye".
