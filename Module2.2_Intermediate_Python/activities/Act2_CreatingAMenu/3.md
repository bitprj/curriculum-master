Heres our code up to this point:

```python
print("Here is your list of options! Type \"exit\" to exit")
options = ["Watch tv", "Go to the park", "Take out the trash"]
for option in options:
    print(option)
```

Remember, when the **for loop** ends, we might want to start over and print the menu again. 

How can we do this? We don't know how many times the whole menu needs to printed since we don't know when the condition to stop is satisfied so we **can't** use a for loop. Don't worry, instead, we can use a **while loop** around the entire code. Make sure to indent the existing code once over to not get an error!

 Your code should now look like this:

```python
while (True):
    print("Here is your list of options! Type \"exit\" to exit")
    options = ["Watch tv", "Go to the park", "Take out the trash"]
		for option in options:
    		print(option)
```

**BE CAREFUL**, as currently constructed, this code is an infinite loop (we will add a statement to break out of this infinite loop later.) If you were to run the code now, `options` will get printed out over and over again until you kill (forcefully stop) the program (usually **Ctrl + C**)

To solve this issue, lets look back at the prompt to see how we exit the loop.

The loop will exit once the user types "exit", so we need to obtain user input.
