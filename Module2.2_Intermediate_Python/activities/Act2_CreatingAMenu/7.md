Here's our code up to this point:

```python
options = ["Exit", "Add an option", "Remove an option"]
while (True):
    print("Here is your menu!")
    print("Pick a number 0-2")
		for i, option in enumerate(options):
    		print(str(i) + ". " + option)
    print("")
    userIn = int(input())
    if (userIn == "exit"):
        break
print("Goodbye!")
```

Although it works fine for all integer user inputs, there would be an error if the user enters in a non-numerical value like "a", which cannot be converted to a number through `int()`, and the program would stop.

Python has a built-in function that can help us with this problem. By  using `isdigit()` on the input we can check if the user enters a valid input, returning `True` if the input is a digit.  However, `isdigit()` only works on strings so we have to cast(chage the type) of  the input after we check if it is a valid input. Even after we use `isdigit()` , how can we make sure only to take in new inputs if `isdigit()` is false? Yes! With a while loop! You may be asking yourself, how can I get my program to only enter the loop if  `isdigit()` returns  `False`? Well, we can simply do that with the  `not` operator and placing it infront of `isdigit()`. Don't forget we have to ask the user for a new input so we can continue with our program. 

Let's also add a message "Your choice >>> " for the user input so the user is less confused. 

Our code now looks like this: 

```python
options = ["Exit", "Add an option", "Remove an option"]
while (True):
    print("Here is your menu!")
    print("Pick a number 0-2")
		for i, option in enumerate(options):
    		print(str(i) + ". " + option)
    print("")
    userIn = input("Your choice >>> ")
    # check if the user input is a numerical string
    while (not userIn.isdigit()):
        print("Please enter a numerical amount")
        userIn = input("Your choice >>> ")
    userIn = int(userIn)
    
    if (userIn == "exit"):
        break
print("Goodbye!")
```

At this point, if we run our program, we see that it prints out each option for the menu and forces the user to input an integer. However, our `if` statment has not changed to match our possible inputs so let's do that now. Since the user can now type three different numbers instead of "exit", we can use `if-elif-else` statements to determine what code should be executed. Even though there are only 3 possible choices for the user to input, 0, 1, and 2, we need to account for any integer inputs that are not one of the choices. Therefore we have 4 possible routes the program can take and we can account for this by using one `if` statment that will break out of the while loop,  two `elif` statements that will add and remove options, and one `else` statement that wiil be used for invalid data where nothing will happen and the while loop will run again.

```python
options = ["Exit", "Add an option", "Remove an option"]
while (True):
    print("Here is your menu!")
    print("Pick a number 0-2")
    
		for i, option in enumerate(options):
    		print(str(i) + ". " + option)
    print("")
    
    userIn = input("Your choice >>> ")
    # check if the user input is a numerical string
    while (not userIn.isdigit()):
        print("Please enter a numerical amount")
        userIn = input("Your choice >>> ")
    userIn = int(userIn)
    
    if (userIn == 0):
        break
    elif (userIn == 1):
        # TODO add option
    elif (userIn == 2):
        # TODO remove option
    else:
        print("Invalid option")
print("Goodbye!")
```

We are now ready to implement adding and removing options.
