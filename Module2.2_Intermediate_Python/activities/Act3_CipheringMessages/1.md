In this activity, we will be writing a Python program that takes in a message and encodes it in two ways: through a "caesar cipher" and symmetrical cipher.

A "caesar cipher" assigns every character in the alphabet to a number and shifts them all by the same amount called a **key**. If the key is 2, then all 'a' will be 'c', since 'c' is two characters over from 'a'. Characters at the end will "wrap" around back to the beginning of the alphabet. If the key was 2, then 'z' would be 'b'. We will be focusing mainly on working with ASCII.

A symmetrical cipher replaces all the letters with their mirror counterparts.

If this is the alphabet

`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`

then the alphabet for translation would be

`zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba`

Here is some example output:

```python
>>> main()
Please enter your message: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Please pick a key: 2
Original msg: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Caesar msg: cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzab
Symmetrical msg: zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
```

Let's first begin by writing our `main()` function.

There will be two inputs: the message to translate and the key for the caesar cipher.

We need user input, so we need two calls to `input()`, one for each of them. Let's store them into variables `msg` for the message and `key` for the caesar cipher key.

```python
def main():
	msg = input("Please enter your message: ")
	key = input("Please pick a key: ")
```

Since `key` is a number, we need to convert it into an **integer**, since all user inputs are **strings**. We can do that on the spot by wrapping the second call to `input()` inside `int()`

```python
def main():
	msg = input("Please enter your message: ")
	key = int(input("Please pick a key: "))
```

We also need to call both cipher functions and store their results into variables for printing back to the user. Both functions need the original message as an argument, but only the caesar cipher needs a key.

```python
def main():
	msg = input("Please enter your message: ")
	key = int(input("Please pick a key: "))
	caesarMsg = caesarCipher(key, msg)
	symmMsg = symmCipher(msg)
```
