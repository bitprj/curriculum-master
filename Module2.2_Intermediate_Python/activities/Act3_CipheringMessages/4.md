Now let's write the symmetric cipher function.

Like `caesarCipher()`, we need to create a variable to hold the encoded message.

```python
def symmCipher(msg):
    newMsg = ""
```

We also need to loop through each character, modify it, and append it to `newMsg`

We can use a **for loop** again with an **integer** index

```python
def symmCipher(msg):
    newMsg = ""
    for i in range(0, len(msg)):
```

We need to recognize that the symmetrical character of 'a' is 'z', 'b' is 'y', 'c' is 'x'.

Well

'a' is zero away from 'a' and 'z' is zero away from 'z'

'b' is one away from 'a' and 'y'  is one away from 'z'

'c' is two away from 'a' and 'x' is two away from 'z'

'd' is three away from 'a' and 'w' is three away from 'z'

Looking at this pattern, we can use the distance away from 'a' or 'z' as the index. The distance away from 'a' is for the original character, so we just need to subtract that distance away from 'z' as for the encoded message. Since 'z' will always have a larger ASCII value, subtract the distance from 'z' instead.

We use `ord()` again for mathematical operations on characters via ASCII.

```python
def symmCipher(msg):
    newMsg = ""
    for i in range(0, len(msg)):
        symmIndex = ord('z') - ord(msg[i]) + ord('a') # remember that ord('a') is here for normalization
```

Now we need to append the encoded message:

```python
def symmCipher(msg):
    newMsg = ""
    for i in range(0, len(msg)):
        symmIndex = ord('z') - msg[i] + ord('a')
        newMsg += chr(symmIndex)
```

Finally, we need to return the encoded message:

```python
def symmCipher(msg):
    newMsg = ""
    for i in range(0, len(msg)):
        symmIndex = ord('z') - msg[i] + ord('a')
        newMsg += chr(symmIndex)
    return newMsg
```

We are finished with the entire program.
