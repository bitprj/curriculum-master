#### Summary
You will write a program that reads and parses a list of Dewey decimal numbers and match it to the correct genre based on the number and then find the distribution of each genre.

#### Long Summary
You will open a file of Dewey decimal numbers and then you have to parse it and store it in the appropriate data structure. After parsing it, you have to interpret the data by writing if statements that will classify the information for you. You will also learn to use patterns to shorten your code.

#### Criteria
- Learn read and parse files and store the data
- How can you use for loops to write efficient code?
- Using loops to access specific pieces of data
