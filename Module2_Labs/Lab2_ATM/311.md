For `deposit()`, we use an **if statement** that checks first for a number. If so, then we will **type cast** the amount to an integer. Remember that amount is a **string**, so we need to convert it to an **integer** to perform mathematical calculations on it. Then we check if the number is valid by using another if statement.

```python
if (not amount.isdigit()):
  print("Invalid amount")
  return balance, False
else:
  amount = int(amount)

if (amount < 0):
  print("Invalid amount")
  return balance, False
  
# print success and return final balance
print("Deposited "+ str(amount)
return balance + amount, True
```

We can return two values if we return in one **tuple**

`withdraw()` is similar, except that we have to also check if there is enough money in the balance to withdraw from. We are checking the DIFFERENCE between `balance` and `amount`.

First we check for a number input before getting the difference. If the input is indeed a number, again we will type cast amount to an integer.

```python
if (not amount.isdigit()):
    print("Invalid amount")
    return balance, False
else:	
  amount = int(amount)
```

Then we get the difference and evaluate that. We already know it's a number from the previous **if statement**.

```python
diff = balance - amount
```

Finally, we have to check whether it's a positive number or not with another **if statement**. We also handle if the withdrawal was successful.

```python
if (diff < 0):
    print("Not enough in balance")
    return balance, False
print("Withdrew: " + str(diff))
return diff, True
```
