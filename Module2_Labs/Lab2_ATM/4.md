Write `printHistory()` and finish writing `logout()` given some of the code already. Our output must match the example output below.

Example output for `printHistory()`

```
printHistory(["Account Creation", "Deposited $10", "Withdrew $5", "Withdrew $5"])
Account Creation
Deposited $10
Withdrew $5
Withdrew $5
```

Example output for `logout()`

```
logout("atm.txt", "1234", "20", ["Account Creation", "Deposited $10", "Withdrew $5", "Withdrew $5"])
```

This function does not print anything out nor return anything. It will instead create a file called "atm.txt" with the following contents:

```
1234
20
Account Creation
Deposited $10
Withdrew $5
Withdrew $5

```

Note the additional **newline** at the end of the file.
