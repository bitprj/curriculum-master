`printHistory()` simply iterates through a **list** using a **for loop** and prints out its elements one by one.

```python
for action in history:
    print(action)
```

We can either parse the file with `open()` and `close()` or use a `with` `as`.

Here is the latter option being used:

```python
with open(atmFileName, 'w') as atmFile:
    atmFile.write(pin + "\n")
    atmFile.write(str(balance) + "\n")
    for action in history:
        atmFile.write(action + "\n")
```

We write line by line to the file, but we need to append a **newline** character since there is no `writeLine()` function.

For `history`, we have iterate through it element by element, since it is a **list**.
