We can call the appropriate functions associated with the proper choice, passing in the correct arguments and retrieving the return values correctly. Choices 1 and 2 have `deposit()` and `withdraw()` both take in an **integer** and a **string** and return a **tuple** of an **integer** and a **boolean**.  The result of the functions `withdraw()` and `deposit()` unpacks the tuple by returning the integer `balance` and boolean `success` which are respectively determined after execution of those functions. For those two functions, we also have to ask the user for input. Choice 3 has `printHistory()` only take in the **list** of strings `history`. Choice 4 will call `logout()` whose arguments match the entire and print out a message.

```python
if (choice == 1):
    amount = input("Deposit amount: $")
    (balance, success) = deposit(balance, amount)
elif (choice == 2):
    amount = input("Withdraw amount: $")
    (balance, success) = withdraw(balance, amount)
elif (choice == 3):
    printHistory(history)
elif (choice == 4):
    logout(atmFileName, pin, balance, history)
    print("Thank you for using ATM!")
    break
else:
    print("Invalid choice")
```
