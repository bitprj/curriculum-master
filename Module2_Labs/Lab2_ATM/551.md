Now we need to **append** to `history` once either `deposit()` or `withdraw()` succeeds. We can use an **if statement** that checks the second element of the **tuple** (the boolean `success`) returned from those two functions.

To check for a successful deposit:

```python
if (success):
    history.append("Deposited $" + str(amount))
```

To check for a successful withdrawal:

```python
if (success):
    history.append("Withdrew $" + str(amount))
```

Notice only the print message is different.
