Let's write a program that functions like a very basic ATM. You first validate a 4-digit pin to log in. You will have three tries. Once logged in, you can either deposit to your account, withdraw from your balance, view all of your past transactions, or save and log out (terminating the program).

Thank you for using ATM!
```

First we will write the `login()` function for ATM. It takes in a parameter `pin` which is the correct PIN. The correct pin that needs to be inputted by the user is defined on the first line of the text file *atm.txt*. This pin Its output should match that of the example output below. After 3 failed attempts, the user should fail to log-in. 

Example output: (the following output assumes the correct PIN is 1234)

```
>>> login("1234")
Enter 4-digit pin: 1234
Logged in successfully!
True

>>> login("5678")
Enter 4-digit pin: 2345
Login failed
Enter 4-digit pin: 5679
Login failed
Enter 4-digit pin: 6789
Login failed
Too many failed attempts
False

>>> login("1234")
Enter 4-digit pin: 1231
Login failed
Enter 4-digit pin: 1232
Login failed
Enter 4-digit pin: 1234
Logged in successfully!
True
```
