We first need an `input()` call to get the name of the file to read

```python
 atmFileName = input("Enter file to read: ")
```

Then we extract all the data we need from that file

```python
with open(atmFileName, 'r') as atmFile:
    pin = atmFile.readline().split('\n')[0]
    balance = int(atmFile.readline().split('\n')[0])
    history = atmFile.read().split('\n')
```

With `with`, the file is closed after the fourth line. The `readline()` reads a single line and `split()` plus the `[0]` is a trick to removing the trailing **newline** character. This was given.
