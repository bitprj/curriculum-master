Write the main function for ATM. Its output should match that of the example output below. We can assume that the program has a file named "atm.txt" in the same directory as the program.

Our `main()` should do the following: 

1. Ask for a filename and read its content
2. Log the user in (use your defined function)
3. Print the menu and handle the menu options accordingly 

Example output:

```
>>> main()
Enter file to read: atm.txt
Enter 4-digit pin: 1234
